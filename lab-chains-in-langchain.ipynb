       "\"Black body radiation refers to the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a perfect black body, which is an idealized physical body that absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation. The radiation emitted by a black body depends only on its temperature and follows a specific distribution known as Planck's law. This radiation is characterized by a continuous spectrum of wavelengths and intensities, with the peak intensity shifting to shorter wavelengths as the temperature of the black body increases. Black body radiation plays a key role in understanding concepts such as thermal radiation and the quantization of energy in quantum mechanics.\""

This ensures that the genetic information is passed on to the next generation of cells. \\n\\nAdditionally, DNA is constantly being used by cells to carry out processes such as protein synthesis, cell division, and repair. Having DNA in every cell allows for the coordination of these processes and ensures that the organism functions properly as a whole. \\n\\nIn summary, every cell in our body contains DNA because it is essential for the proper functioning and development of all living organisms.'"
